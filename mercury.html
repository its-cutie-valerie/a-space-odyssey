                  Hey kids! Let’s take a quick trip to Mercury, the coolest hot
                  planet out there! (Wait, can a planet be cool and hot? Let’s
                  find out!)
                </h2>
                <h3>What’s Mercury All About?</h3>
                <p>
                  Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, which makes it a
                  total daredevil. It zooms around the Sun faster than any other
                  planet—88 Earth days for one lap! That’s less than three
                  months. No wonder it’s called the speedy planet!
                </p>
                <h3>Daytime BBQ, Nighttime Freeze!</h3>
                <p>
                  Since Mercury is so close to the Sun, its days are super
                  hot—like, over 800°F (430°C). That’s hotter than your mom’s
                  oven! But at night, it gets freezing cold, down to -290°F
                  (-180°C). Brrr! Mercury doesn’t have much of an atmosphere to
                  keep it warm, so it’s like a giant rocky popsicle when the Sun
                  goes to bed.
                </p>
                <h3>Why So Small, Mercury?</h3>
                <p>
                  Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System—it’s even
                  smaller than some moons! Imagine if Earth was a basketball;
                  Mercury would be more like a baseball. But don’t let its size
                  fool you—it’s packed with craters and cool rocks from asteroid
                  crashes. Think of it as a galactic battle scar champion!
                </p>
                <h3>No Moon Buddies, No Rings—Just Mercury!</h3>
                <p>
                  Unlike Saturn with its fancy rings or Jupiter with its moon
                  squad, Mercury likes to keep things simple. No moons, no
                  rings—just raw planetary awesomeness.
                </p>

                <h3>Fun Fact to Share with Your Friends:</h3>
                <p>
                  Did you know Mercury’s days are longer than its years? Yep! A
                  single day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176
                  Earth days. Imagine one day of school lasting half the year!
                  Yikes!
                </p>
                <p>
                  So there you have it—Mercury, the speedy, rocky little planet
                  that’s as tough as it is fascinating. Keep exploring, space
                  cadets! The universe is full of wonders.
