                  Yo, space cadets! Buckle up and get ready to meet Neptune, the
                  most mysterious and wildly windy planet in the Solar System.
                  It’s the farthest planet from the Sun, but it’s still making
                  waves in the cosmos!
                </h2>
                <h3>Big, Blue, and Beautiful</h3>
                <p>
                  Neptune is a gorgeous deep blue, thanks to methane gas in its
                  atmosphere. But it’s not just a pretty face—it’s a massive ice
                  giant packed with frozen water, ammonia, and methane beneath
                  its thick, stormy clouds. It’s like the coolest smoothie in
                  space!
                </p>
                <h3>Storm Chasers’ Dream</h3>
                <p>
                  Neptune is home to the fastest winds in the Solar System—they
                  can blow up to 1,200 miles per hour. That’s faster than a
                  fighter jet! These crazy winds power massive storms, including
                  the Great Dark Spot, a giant storm as big as Earth that comes
                  and goes like a cosmic magic trick.
                </p>
                <h3>The Farthest Planet</h3>
                <p>
                  Neptune orbits super far from the Sun—about 30 times farther
                  than Earth. Because of this, it’s freezing cold out there,
                  with temperatures dipping to -373°F (-225°C). And since it’s
                  so far, a year on Neptune takes 165 Earth years! That’s longer
                  than a human lifetime. Imagine celebrating your first birthday
                  at age 165!
                </p>
                <h3>Ring-a-Ding-Ding—Again!</h3>
                <p>
                  Like its buddy Uranus, Neptune has faint rings made of dust
                  and ice. They’re not as famous as Saturn’s, but they still
                  give Neptune some extra cosmic bling.
                </p>
                <h3>Moons That Steal the Show</h3>
                <p>
                  Neptune has 14 moons, and the star of the show is Triton.
                  Triton is a total weirdo—it orbits Neptune backward!
                  Scientists think it was a captured object from the Kuiper
                  Belt, a region of icy bodies at the edge of the Solar System.
                  Oh, and Triton has geysers that shoot icy stuff into space.
                  Talk about making an entrance!
                </p>
                <h3>Fast Spins, Long Trips</h3>
                <p>
                  A day on Neptune is just 16 hours long, so it’s spinning
                  pretty fast. But with a year lasting 165 Earth years, Neptune
                  takes its time making the long trip around the Sun. You’d
                  definitely have a lot of time for stargazing out there!
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Fun Fact to Share with Your Friends:</h3>
                <p>
                  Neptune was discovered before anyone saw it with a telescope!
                  Astronomers in 1846 noticed its gravity was pulling on Uranus,
                  so they used math to predict where Neptune would be. Math
                  saves the day!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though we’ve sent spacecraft like Voyager 2 to fly by
                  Neptune, we’ve barely scratched the surface of its mysteries.
                  With its wild winds, icy moons, and deep blue beauty, Neptune
                  is a planet of endless discovery.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So there you have it—Neptune, the stormy superstar of the
                  Solar System! Keep dreaming big, because the universe is
                  waiting for YOU to explore it.
