# A Space Odyssey / Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Welcome to my space project! This repository is a nostalgic return to the 1990s, where space exploration and curiosity about the cosmos skyrocketed alongside pixelated graphics, neon aesthetics, and playful experimentation.

## About the Project
This project was developed for a 90s-themed [Cod√©dex](https://www.codedex.io/home) hackathon, blending educational content about the planets in our solar system with retro design elements of the golden age of dial-up internet and CD-ROM encyclopedias.

My goal was to create an fun, interactive, and visually vibrant way to learn about the planets while embracing the charm of the 90s. Expect bold colors, fun animations, and an interface that might remind you of the days of Netscape Navigator.

## Features
- **Interactive Planet Profiles**: Click on a planet to explore facts, images, and trivia.
- **Astronomical Trivia**: Learn quirky and fascinating facts about each planet.
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden 90s references for those who dare to explore!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (retro styling with bright colors and fonts), JavaScript (vanilla for simplicity... used purely for the absolutely not annoying mouse trail).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/its-cutie-valerie/a-space-odyssey.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd a-space-odyssey
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage
- Open the project in a browser and click on the planets to learn more about them.
- Use the navigation bar to explore the solar system.
- Try to uncover hidden Easter eggs by interacting with elements on the page.

## Acknowledgements
